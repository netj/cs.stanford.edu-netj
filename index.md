Hi, I'm **Jaeho Shin**, currently the Chief Engineer at
**[<span style="color:#2F6FF6 !important;">Evidently</span>](https://evidently.com)**, where
<span style="color:#2F6FF6; font-weight:600;">
we are building a better future of healthcare with data-driven technologies.
If you are looking for ways to use your excellent software engineering skills and technical expertise in AI/ML/NLP and big data to do genuine good for society and humanity, we are a great team to check out.
Please get in touch with me via email: **[netj at CS.Stanford EDU](mailto:netj)**.

I <span title="defended my thesis in oral exam but did not complete writing and submitting my dissertation due to health/personal reasons">nearly finished</span> my PhD in [Computer Science at Stanford University][Stanford CS] in 2016, where I spent most of my time with [Hazy Group][] and [InfoLab][] members, working on [Accelerating Knowledge Base Construction][oral-exam-slides].
I moved to [Lattice Data, then Apple (who acquired them)](https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/13/apple-acquires-ai-company-lattice-data-a-specialist-in-unstructured-dark-data/) to continue the work, expanding and improving the Knowledge Graph powering the Siri voice assistant.

At Stanford, I worked with [Chris Ré][Christopher Ré] to study how we can do more productive development of *end-to-end knowledge base construction systems*, such as those built with [DeepDive][], by creating tools like [Mindtagger][].
For Spring 2015 and 2014 quarters, I helped running the [CS346][] database implementation course.
Before that, I worked closely with [Jennifer Widom][], [Andreas Paepcke][], [Semih Salihoglu][], and [Jiwon Seo][] on problems such as data management for computational experiments ([3X][]), debugging programs for distributed graph processing systems ([Graft][]), designing a domain-specific language for graph analysis ([Socialite][]), and compiling subgraph matching queries ([SmallGraphs][]).
I was a course assistant for [CS245][] in Winter 2014, helping [Hector Garcia-Molina][] to add new MySQL assignments.
Before coming to Stanford in 2011, I worked for [Samsung Electronics][] for a few years after finishing my MS at [Seoul National University][SNU CSE] and BS at [KAIST][KAIST CS] in Korea.
At Samsung, I worked on a wide range of research and development projects from prototyping tablet devices to creating software engineering tools for understanding and re-engineering legacy code.
During [my master's program][ROPAS page] with [Kwangkeun Yi][], I studied programming language theories and static program analysis techniques and built a static array index overrun analyzer for C programs which became part of [Fasoo.com][]'s [Sparrow][], a commercial software security analyzer widely used in South Korea.

I enjoy writing code and designing programs both professionally and in my spare time.
Some of my creations are
[remocon][],
[libzygote][],
[mkmimo][],
[BuildKit][],
[Markdown-Diff][],
[YouScript][],
[KAIST File Archive][],
[bpm][],
and [my dotfiles][dotfiles].
Check out [my GitHub page][my github] for other things as well.

For my publication record, please refer to my [Google Scholar page][].
